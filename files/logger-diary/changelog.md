## Windows
> ✅ Tested on `Windows 7 Pro SP1 32-bit`

- > The PHP runtime has been updated to [8.1.8](https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-8.1.8-Win32-vs16-x86.zip).

- > VC++ 2015-2019 Redistributable is now packaged in the installer

- > The executables are now compiled to *32-bit*, instead of *64-bit*.
  >
  > 
  >
  > This because Logger-Diary is a lightweight  application and does not need to utilise the full processor power a 64-bit processor has. 
  >
  > **This also opens up some older devices running Windows 7 or 10 on 32-bit processors.**

# <u>v.1.0.0.8</u>
_Released as v.1.0.0_

Initial release, with known bugs and missing features. But it has basic functionality and so is fit to be a first release.

<https://github.com/mar-on-github/logger-diary/compare/v1.0.0.8...v1.0.0.7>


## Windows
> ✅ Tested on `Windows 11 21H2 ×64`

This version update should fix the app not starting at all, but also brings back some bugs that'll be taken for granted for now.

Windows is for now the only OS with an Out-Of-The-Box downloadable installer.
